function [F_individual, F_overall] = h4F1(computed, truth)
% H4F1 computes the F1 score for clustering algorithms.
% Arguments:
%   computed = vector of cluster assignments as computed by a clustering
%   algorithm
%   truth = truth vector of cluster assignments 
% 
%  OUTPUT:
%       F_individual = individual F1 scores for each cluster
%       F_overall    = overall F1 score for algorithm, it's the mean
%       average of the individual F1 scores

    % TODO implement h4F1
